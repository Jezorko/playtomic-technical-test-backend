# Technical Test 

Hey! If you are here, that means you are part of our hiring process. Welcome!

We have two versions of our exercise. The goal is the same, but you can choose your preferred database: a relational database or MongoDB. Pick whatever you feel more comfortable with.

To start it, checkout either `exercise-2024-sql` or `exercise-2024-mongodb` branch. You will find a more detailed README there.
